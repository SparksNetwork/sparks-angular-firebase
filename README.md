# Sparks Angular + Firebase Monorepo.

```

  /functions # see note
    /client
      /src # started with ng cli
      /dist
        /bundled # result of ng build:client, target path deployed by firebase hosting
        /ngfactory # result of ng build:ssr, referenced by server-side express server running in `/functions/server/src/client`
        /ssr # part of the above's build process, not actually sure if this is used or needed, i think if you dont set an outDir in the tsconfig.ssr.json then it writes to your src dir
    /e2e # e2e tests currently run against dev server using `ng e2e`
    /server
      /src # TS containing http, database functions
      /dist # path referenced by /functions/index.js functions bootstrapper
```

## Why Everything in /functions?

A chain of tragic consequences...

1. `firebase-functions` requires everything that it runs live in the `/functions` directory.  Nothing besides that gets deployed to the cloud.
2. SSR implemented by `/functions/server/src/client` needs to get bits from angular app including html
3. Both `/functions/client` and `/functions/server` code need to import shared code from `/functions/shared`

## How Backend Firebase-Functions Work

When you `firebase deploy`, all of the names exported by `/functions/index.js` start running in the cloud.
